# AI Pull Request Workflow

This is the canonical PR loop for `pallete-maker`.

## Roles

- Claude owns architecture, repository memory, CI/CD health, and local
  orchestration, and is the default implementation agent.
- The selected implementation agent writes scoped code on a feature branch.
- GitHub Actions runs `baseline-checks`, `guard`, and `AI Review`.
- Vercel provides preview deployments for PRs and production deploy on merge to
  `main`.
- A human remains the final merge authority.

## Standard Loop

1. Start from current `main`.
2. Create or update one active `specs/<feature-id>/` folder.
3. Create an isolated macOS worktree for the task under
   `<repoRoot>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>/`.
4. Select the implementation and review agents for the branch.
5. Generate the implementation prompt from repository memory.
6. Implement only the scoped change on that branch.
7. Update `tasks.md`, docs, and tests or validation notes in the same PR.
8. Open or update the same PR.
9. Wait for:
   - `baseline-checks`
   - `guard`
   - `AI Review`
   - healthy Vercel preview deployment
10. Keep fixing the same branch until only human approval and merge remain.

## Hard Gates

- Product changes in `index.html`, `src/`, future app code, or runtime config do
  not start without an active `specs/<feature-id>/` folder.
- Local product edits in the main checkout do not count as completed work.
- If the selected implementation agent path is unavailable, stop and report the
  blocker instead of bypassing the loop.
- A PR is not done while required checks are queued, running, or red.

## Review Contract

- Reviewer selection comes only from `AI_REVIEW_AGENT`.
- Supported review backends are `gemini`, `codex`, and `claude`.
- `AI Review` is the normalized required check regardless of the backend.
- Low-severity-only findings are advisory and non-blocking.
- With no repository override, the pull-request gate defaults to `gemini`.
- Auto-retrigger on `synchronize` is not supported for any backend: all
  three reject bot-posted trigger comments. The gate therefore stays in
  `trigger_mode=skip` on every `pull_request` event and passively waits
  for a same-head native review.
- Initial PR review is covered by Gemini Code Assist's on-open auto-review.
  After a new push on an already-open PR, a human must post the appropriate
  native trigger comment (`/gemini review`, `@codex review`, or
  `@claude review once`), or run `pnpm run review:switch -- --to <agent>`
  to flip backends and trigger the new reviewer in one shot.
- Manual Gemini and Codex review commands stay native-only so they do not
  cancel the PR-linked `AI Review` check.

## Merge-Ready Definition

The current PR head SHA is merge-ready only when:

- `baseline-checks` is green
- `guard` is green
- `AI Review` is green
- Vercel preview is healthy for the changed flow
- no blocking review findings remain unresolved
- no merge conflicts remain
